# Final_Project
Connect 4 Code

For our final project, we coded a Connect4 game. We began with coding a two person interactive game, but then replaced the second player with an AI "player". Before running the code, ensure that you import sys, numpy, pygame, math, and random.  Upon running the code, a Connect4 board will pop up. You will then be able to choose the difficulty level of the AI (i.e. how hard it is to beat the computer). The player who gets to place their chip first is randomized. Therefore, sometimes a green chip (AI chip) will be placed first, and sometimes a red chip will appear above the board, which you can drag along the top using your mouse/keypad and click above the column in which you would like to drop it. After you place the chip, the AI will place theirs 500 ms after you place yours. We have programmed the AI to recognize potential wins for both its opponent (you) and for itself. Therefore, it will be able to block its opponent when they have 3 in a row and will recognize moves it should make itself in order to win. The placing of the chips will continue until someone wins, at which point "_____ is the champ!!!" will flash across the top of the screen, or until the board is filled and it's a draw. Either way, the game will end. You can then play again by running the code again. Thanks so much for a great semester and we hope you enjoy!
